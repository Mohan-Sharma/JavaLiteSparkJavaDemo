# SparkJavaLiteDemo(In Progress)
This repository demonstrates how we can use JavaLite ActiveJDBC for Database connection management along with SparkJava for microservices and Google Guice for dependency injection.

Steps to run the application.

1. Clone the demo and import to IDE
2. Go to pom.xml then right click -> maven -> reimport.
3. In order to start the server, navigate in the terminal to the root directory of the project where the pom.xml exits and do mvn process-classes then run the main class ApplicationBootstrap.java. This will start the application.
4. Navigate to "http://localhost:4567/student" for accessing the application.
5. Before everything run the basic.sql script.
6. Manipulate "database.properties" accordingly.
